                    In 1998, the SOPs Murray left the corporation in which he worked for several years. On the same day, he called his brother Ian and invited him to do the same. A few years later the brothers opened Vineyard Vines - apparel brand, which is now estimated

                    In 1998 Shepa Murray was one particularly bad day. During the delivery of the annual report in the New York marketing company 27 years Shepa asked to think "more creative". Instead, he resigned.

                <br>
                <p>
                    Later in the day, he called his younger brother Ian, who worked in Manhattan in a small PR firm. SOPs told his brother that he resigned and invited him to do the same thing - he had long known that Ian also did not like his work. Five minutes later, 23-year-old
                    Ian called his brother and said he listened to the advice.

                <p>
                    Despite the fact that the two brothers were out of work, we can not say that they went nowhere. They have long been brewing business idea and now finally have the time to implement it.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    During a trip to Anguilla (overseas territory of the UK) in 1997, where their parents were working-journalists, SOPs and Ian talked about the establishment of the company for the sale of high-quality and expensive ties.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    After a few drunk cocktails in the lobby bar, the brothers told the hotel manager about his idea. "We did not know how to implement it. The manager just took a guide with the New York numbers and we began to ring them ", - says SOPs.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Back in New York, Murray brothers put off the idea, because the work was too much. But only until such time as the ee it was not entirely in 1998. Now they have time to engage in the creation of his company.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    "Everyone was shocked by the fact that we left a high-paying job. My girlfriend, who is now my wife, was also not happy, "- says the SOPs. The Brothers opened the company for their money and called her Vineyard Vines.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Sly way they were able to do without the investment. They bought an old Jeep and Ford Bronco, and then removed all the available money with credit cards. This was sufficient for the first time. Then the brothers started looking for contacts in the fashion
                    industry and design - the former corporate communication is very helpful.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    "While no one wore ties, except for a wedding or graduation. We thought that the reason is boredom. Ties did not look very interesting, "- says Ian. The idea was that the brothers to reach a younger audience. Therefore ties looked bright and catchy.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The first buyers of the brothers found rolling on the beach with rucksacks stuffed with ties. So they hoped to find younger buyers who are interested in products Vineyard Vines.

                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    After nearly 20 years, the brothers say they have never regretted the dismissal. SOPs adds that withdrawal from work and opening their businesses greater inspiration than a scarecrow: "People want security and financial stability. The reality is that
                    we had the passion to create something of their own. We felt it, so felt, and others. "
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Ian said that in the beginning there were a few minor scandals, but almost always brothers could rely on each other. Every day they began to fill in the task list - their goal was to perform 10 tasks on a daily basis. At first, the brothers worked from
                    home, but then rented several office spaces in Connecticut, where they came from.

                <br>
                <p>
                    Now at 91 Vineyard Vines store. The company employs 650 staff, but the brothers plan to increase their number to 2600. The brand also expanded its product line - now they sell clothes and accessories for men, women and children. But the main feature of
                    the company - the vivid colors and patterns - remained unchanged
                </p>

                <p>
                    SOPs Murray believes that the only advice he could give to those who want to become an entrepreneur - to quit while you're still young. "Quality of life is more important than financial rewards. This idea is still motivates us and our team ", - adds his
                    brother.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The brothers believe that the older the person, the harder it is to get away from their homes. They saw a lot of 30 and 40-year-olds, who were dissatisfied with their work, but they could not leave because of financial obligations.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    "In old age, you will not want to live with the idea that it was necessary to try more. If you do not try, how you do know if you have success awaits? - Says SOPs. - Many people determine the success of money, but it does not always lead to a happy and
                    productive life. "
